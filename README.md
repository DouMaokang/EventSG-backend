## Description
EventSG is created for event creation, registration, rating and venue renting for event organizers, participants and venue owners based in Singapore. 

It allows people to easily find events of their interest and enrich their social life. Event organizers can utilize such a platform to manage, promote and improve their events. Meanwhile, it bridges the gap between event organizers and venue owners so that event organizers can rent venues of their preferences.
